**vvintage** PHP Project

**Overview**

vvintage is a work-in-progress e-commerce project built using PHP, OOP, and template-based architecture. 
The project is designed with a layered architecture approach, including Controllers, Services, Models, Repositories, DTOs, and Routers, to maintain clean and organized code.

This project is currently under development and serves as a platform for practicing real-world PHP development and architecture patterns.


**Features (Implemented So Far)**

- Layered architecture (MVC-like): clear separation between controllers, services, repositories, models, and DTOs.

- User authentication: login and registration forms with basic validation.

- Multi-language support: translations available in 7 languages.

- Database integration: each main entity (e.g., products, users) has its own model and repository.

- OOP principles: classes, interfaces, and structured methods used throughout the project.

- Template-based PHP pages: separation of logic and views for maintainability.


**Technologies**

- PHP 8

- MySQL / RedBean ORM

- HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript (basic)

- Template-based rendering


Project Status

Project is actively under development.

Some features are not yet implemented, including advanced filtering, full admin panel, and payment integration.

Architecture is being refined to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.



Notes

This project is primarily a learning and practice project, focusing on understanding PHP layered architecture, OOP concepts, and working with multiple languages and user authentication.
